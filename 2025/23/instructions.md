# Challenge #23: Gift route

Santa Claus 🎅 has to deliver presents in a town represented as a **grid map**.

Each cell on the map can be:

- `S` → Santa's starting point (where the presents are)
- `G` → House that must receive a present
- `.` → Free path
- `#` → Obstacle (cannot be crossed)

Santa makes independent deliveries for each present. He leaves from `S`, delivers the present to a house `G` and **immediately returns to** `S` to pick up the next one. However, for this challenge, **we only want to calculate the sum of the minimum one-way distances** from `S` to each house `G`.

## 🎯 Your goal

Write the function `minStepsToDeliver(map)` that returns the **total number of steps** required to reach all the houses with presents from the starting position.

### Keep in mind:

- You always start from the initial position `S`.
- For each present, you must calculate the **minimum distance** from `S` to that house `G`.
- Obstacles (`#`) cannot be crossed.
- If any house with a present is unreachable, the function must return `-1`.

## 🧩 Examples
``` js
minStepsToDeliver([
  ['S', '.', 'G'],
  ['.', '#', '.'],
  ['G', '.', '.']
])
// Result: 4

/* 
Explanation:
- Minimum distance from S (0,0) to G (0,2): 2 steps
- Minimum distance from S (0,0) to G (2,0): 2 steps
- Total: 2 + 2 = 4
*/

minStepsToDeliver([
  ['S', '#', 'G'],
  ['#', '#', '.'],
  ['G', '.', '.']
])
// Result: -1
// (The house at (0,2) is unreachable due to obstacles)

minStepsToDeliver([['S', 'G']])
// Result: 1
```

## 🎯 Rules

- The map always contains exactly one `S`.
- There can be zero or more houses with presents (`G`).
- The order of deliveries doesn't matter, as each is measured independently from `S`.
- You must return the **sum of the minimum one-way distances**.

## 🧠 Hint

- Calculate the shortest distance from `S` to each `G` (you can use a Breadth-First Search or BFS algorithm).
If any present has no possible path, the total result is `-1`.
